### Contributions

Contributions are always welcome!

#### Running the extension locally for development

1. Clone the repository and install dependencies by running `yarn install`
2. Press `F5` to open a new window with your extension loaded.
3. Run your command from the command palette by pressing (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P` on Mac) and typing `Postcode: Create Request`.

#### Folder structure

- **`package.json`** - this is the manifest file in which you declare your extension and command. The plugin registers a command and defines its title and command name. With this information VS Code can show the command in the command palette.
- **`webview`**: folder where you will find entire React code
- **`src/extension.ts`**: this is the main file where you will provide the implementation of your command. The file exports one function, `activate`, which is called the very first time your extension is activated (in this case by executing the command). Inside the `activate` function we call `registerCommand`. We pass the function containing the implementation of the command as the second parameter to `registerCommand`.

#### Making changes

- You can relaunch the extension from the debug toolbar after changing code in `src/extension.ts`.
- You can also reload (`Ctrl+R` or `Cmd+R` on Mac) the VS Code window with your extension to load your changes.
